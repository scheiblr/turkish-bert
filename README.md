We present community-driven BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA and ConvBERT models for Turkish üéâ

Some datasets used for pretraining and evaluation are contributed from the
awesome Turkish NLP community, as well as the decision for the BERT model name: BERTurk.

# Stats

The current version of the model is trained on a filtered and sentence
segmented version of the Turkish [OSCAR corpus](https://traces1.inria.fr/oscar/),
a recent Wikipedia dump, various [OPUS corpora](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) and a
special corpus provided by [Kemal Oflazer](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ko/).

The final training corpus has a size of 35GB and 4,404,976,662 tokens.

Thanks to Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC) we can train both cased and
uncased models on a TPU v3-8. You can find the TensorBoard outputs for
the training here:

* [TensorBoard cased model](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/ZgFk8LclQOKdW0pYWviLMg/)
* [TensorBoard uncased model](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/5LlD11cWRwexyqKSEPPXGA/)

We also provide cased and uncased models that a≈ïe using a larger vocab size (128k instead of 32k).

A detailed cheatsheet of how the models were trained, can be found [here](CHEATSHEET.md).

## C4 Multilingual dataset (mC4)

We've also trained an ELECTRA (cased) model on the recently released Turkish part of the
[multiligual C4 (mC4) corpus](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/discussions/5265) from the AI2 team.

After filtering documents with a broken encoding, the training corpus has a size of 242GB resulting
in 31,240,963,926 tokens.

We used the original 32k vocab (instead of creating a new one).

# *DistilBERTurk*

The distilled version of a cased model, so called *DistilBERTurk*, was trained
on 7GB of the original training data, using the cased version of *BERTurk*
as teacher model.

*DistilBERTurk* was trained with the official Hugging Face implementation from
[here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/distillation).

The cased model was trained for 5 days on 4 RTX 2080 TI.

More details about distillation can be found in the
["DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)
paper by Sanh et al. (2019).

# ELECTRA

In addition to the *BERTurk* models, we also trained ELEC**TR**A small and base models. A detailed overview can be found
in the [ELECTRA section](electra/README.md).

# ConvBERTurk

In addition to the BERT and ELECTRA based models, we also trained a ConvBERT model. The ConvBERT architecture is presented
in the ["ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02496) paper.

We follow a different training procedure: instead of using a two-phase approach, that pre-trains the model for 90% with 128
sequence length and 10% with 512 sequence length, we pre-train the model with 512 sequence length for 1M steps on a v3-32 TPU.

More details about the pre-training can be found [here](convbert/README.md).

# mC4 ELECTRA

In addition to the ELEC**TR**A base model, we also trained an ELECTRA model on the Turkish part of the mC4 corpus. We use a
sequence length of 512 over the full training time and train the model for 1M steps on a v3-32 TPU.

# Evaluation

In 2024 we ran new evaluations on Pos Tagging and NER datasets. Prior evaluation results can be found [here](OLD_EVALUATIONS.md).

# Model usage

All trained models can be used from the [DBMDZ](https://github.com/dbmdz) Hugging Face [model hub page](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz)
using their model name. The following models are available:

* *BERTurk* models with 32k vocabulary: `dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased` and `dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-uncased`
* *BERTurk* models with 128k vocabulary: `dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-128k-cased` and `dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-128k-uncased`
* *ELECTRA* small and base cased models (discriminator): `dbmdz/electra-small-turkish-cased-discriminator` and `dbmdz/electra-base-turkish-cased-discriminator`
* *ELECTRA* base cased and uncased models, trained on Turkish part of mC4 corpus (discriminator): `dbmdz/electra-small-turkish-mc4-cased-discriminator` and `dbmdz/electra-small-turkish-mc4-uncased-discriminator`
* *ConvBERTurk* model with 32k vocabulary: `dbmdz/convbert-base-turkish-cased`
* *ConvBERTurk* base cased and uncased models, trained on Turkish part of mC4 corpus: `dbmdz/convbert-base-turkish-mc4-cased` and `dbmdz/convbert-base-turkish-mc4-uncased`

Example usage with ü§ó/Transformers:

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased")

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased")
```

This loads the *BERTurk* cased model. The recently introduced ELEC**TR**A base model can be loaded with:

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/electra-base-turkish-cased-discriminator")

model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained("dbmdz/electra-base-turkish-cased-discriminator")
```
